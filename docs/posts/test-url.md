# Hello World!
This would be an interesting article, in which we can talk about things of importance, like markdown, and how the world should run on it.  
  
This is the next paragraph, in case you were wondering. Markdown is cool because it's *fancy* and **strong**. Cough cough ~~RTF.~~  
  
One thing you should consider is code and `monospace`:

```python
print("Hello World!")
```
